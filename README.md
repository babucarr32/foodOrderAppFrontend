# Food Order App

Are you an individual developer who frequently orders food for yourself or your team? The usual routine involves manually asking each person what they'd like to eat for the day. This process can become quite tedious over time.

**Introducing my innovative Food Order App!** It's designed to streamline and simplify this process. With my app, you can register and place your food orders independently, eliminating the hassle of manual order collection.

But what if you forget to place an order? No worries, my smart algorithm has got you covered. It can scan through your favorite dishes and place a random order on your behalf, ensuring you never go hungry.

What's more, the backend system includes a handy feature that schedules order submissions via SMS to the restaurant at a designated time during the day. This means you can forget about the daily task of chasing down orders.

Ready to revolutionize your food ordering experience? Access the backend of my app [here](https://github.com/babucarr32/foodOrderServer). Be sure to review the instructions in the backend repository to set up everything correctly. Enjoy the convenience and efficiency of the Food Order App!
